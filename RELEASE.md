# Releasing matrix-wysiwyg

Normally this would be done by the project owners.

Here are the steps we take:

1. Choose a version number

We use semantic versioning.

It can't be anything that has been pushed to any package repo before.

2. Add a changelog entry

Currently this is stored in platforms/web/CHANGELOG.md.

TODO: store the canonical version in the project root, and copy it to there
so the NPM packaging can find it.

3. Set the version number

Currently this is manual:

* Edit platforms/web/package.json
* Edit bindings/wysiwyg-ffi/Cargo.toml
* Edit bindings/wysiwyg-wasm/Cargo.toml
* Edit crates/wysiwyg/Cargo.toml
* Edit bindings/wysiwyg-wasm/package.json
* Edit platforms/android/gradle.properties
* (For iOS the release script uses the git tag, so nothing to do I think.)
* `git checkout -b version-0.1.0`
* `git commit -a -m "Version 0.1.0"`
* `git tag 0.1.0 && git push --tags`
* Now push your branch and make a PR, and get it merged.

TODO: make a script that sets the git tag and pushes it, and updates the
various files containing the version number. And checks that the changelog
entry has been created.

4. Create the packages

* Web: manually launch the
  [github action](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-wysiwyg/actions/workflows/publish.yml)
  which will package the code and upload it to NPM. It uses the version number
  it finds in package.json, which you updated above.

* Android: TODO

* Swift/iOS:
  Run `./release_ios.sh` which will open a PR against
  [the swift package repo](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-wysiwyg-composer-swift)
  with the latest from main

TODO: automate all of this using a single github workflow that triggers when we
create a github release.

TODO: update release_io.sh to handle tags/releases
