# Matrix Rich Text Editor

A cross-platform rich text editor intended for use in Matrix clients including
the Element clients.

Works on Web, Android and iOS using a cross-platform core written in Rust,
and platform-specific wrappers.

## Live demo

Try it out at
[matrix-org.github.io/matrix-wysiwyg](https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-wysiwyg/).

## Building the code

Get the prerequisites for each platform by reading the READMEs for them:

* WASM/JavaScript:
  [bindings/wysiwyg-wasm/README.md](bindings/wysiwyg-wasm/README.md)

* Android/Kotlin or iOS/Swift:
  [bindings/wysiwyg-ffi/README.md](bindings/wysiwyg-ffi/README.md)

Now, to build all the bindings, try:

```bash
make
```

To build for a single platform, or to learn more, see the individual README
files above.

## Release the code

See [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md).

## More info

  same way as if it had been done manually.
